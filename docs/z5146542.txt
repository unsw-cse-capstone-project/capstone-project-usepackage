Week 1
We formed a group and created a Jira account under the project name 'usepackage'. Altogether we discussed what kind of custom project to do, and I proposed a online music score editor, which is hardly used in contrast to online text editors. Ultimately, we decided we would be working on a online sound editor (also rarely used), and we gathered some information of some sample online editors, primarily their strengths and their weaknesses. We also found an audio API that we could potentially use for the project. We have created a draft project description and had it sent to our client for revision.

Week 2
After getting feedback from the client, we modified the project description so that there are no ambiguities. I wrote a rough response to the questions the client had, and the scrum master (Madhav), who originally sent the first email to the client, tweaked the response and sent it back to the client for approval. On Friday, we had another meeting and we started on sorting out the user stories. I also had the chance to get a basic jist on how to use the backlog for Jira. Although we have not posted anything significant on the backlog of Jira yet, my teammates and I formed user stories on overleaf, where we designed a nontrivial amount of user stories and their corresponding acceptance criteria. This is almost done; once this is finished, we plan on moving all the user stories to the backlog. In the meantime, I am going familiarise myself with overleaf and typescript.
