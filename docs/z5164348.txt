Week 1
Tuesday - Group was formed, chose the name usepackage and I was given the role of scrum master.
We set up Jira and spent the day looking for ideas for a project, mostly fruitlessly.
Initially taken by the idea of an in-browser musical score writer, we ended up settling on an audio editor.

Friday - Starting writing the proposal and researching existing online audio editors. 
We also decided on using the web audio API, and discussed a few ideas for how we would edit the audio.
We sent Rachid a preproposal containing our basic ideas to see if they needed improvement.

Week 2
Tuesday - We reviewed our preproposal in light of Rachid's feedback, and sent him an updated email.
Friday - After having received approval, we started writing user stories, epic stories and acceptance criteria.

Week 3
Firday - Decided on user story points, as well as mapped objectives to user stories. 
Saturday and Sunday - Wrote what we had for the proposal in overleaf. Made a table for our research on 
other audio editors. Simon and I worked in the interface flow diagrams, while Rajiv worked
on the system architecture diagram and Ethan drew them up in tikz. Rui did most of the 
writing and editing of the report itself. We submitted the report on Sunday.
