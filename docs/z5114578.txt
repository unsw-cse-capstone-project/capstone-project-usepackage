Week 1
Tuesday -   Group formed. Had some trouble setting up Jira, but it was succesfully done. Spent a couple of hours trying to look for a decent project to do. Eventually settled on an audio editing software. Waiting on GitHub access.
Friday -    Basically sketched out how the audio will work. I wrote up the main description based off my teammates' innovative ideas. LaTeX template set up for the project proposal.

Week 2
Sunday -    Feedback was received from Rachid on the project. We saw that there was a fair bit more work for us to do with drafting the idea. Tried to plan a meeting but it didn't happen.
Monday -    Planned meeting again, and this time it did happen. Draft proposal was fleshed out a lot more clearly. Better objectives were described. I redid my description to correspond to our new objectives. The team researched carefully on issues including drawbacks of preexisting sound editors, and minor things we forgot e.g. no administrator.
Tuesday -   Approval was given for the project. Polished up description further. Team members were understandably tired so we agreed to continue this later.
Wednesday - GitHub access granted. Set it up, and uploaded journal
Friday -    User stories with acceptance criteria were made. I wrote three user stories and checked over all of them.

Week 3
Monday -    Estimated priorities for the user stories for the team.
Tuesday -   Missed out on the lesson because I read ghost words in the email and thought it was rescheduled to tomorrow. Apologised deeply to my teammates. Reviewed all the objectives and compared them to the user stories. Reviewed the user story priorities and also began the planning poker for the story points. 
Friday -    Planning poker done; collectively agreed on user story points (facilitated some discussion as Scrum master was far too busy today). Priorities are also locked in. Sprints were made and agreed upon.
Saturday -  Watched Simon construct the interface diagrams. Picked up on missing features and verified that everything that needed to be included (ito my knowledge) was there. Now awaiting rest of group to check diagrams. 
Sunday -    The team met up again to finalise the proposal. I arrived as soon as worked finished. I checked over the entire prooposal for grammatical errors, and also to clear up any ambiguities appearing here and there in the document.
