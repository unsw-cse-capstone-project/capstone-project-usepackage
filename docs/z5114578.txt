Week 1
Tuesday - Group formed. Had some trouble setting up Jira, but it was succesfully done. Spent a couple of hours trying to look for a decent project to do. Eventually settled on an audio editing software. Waiting on GitHub access.
Friday -  Basically sketched out how the audio will work. I wrote up the main description based off my teammates' innovative ideas. LaTeX template set up for the project proposal.

Week 2
Sunday -  Feedback was received from Rachid on the project. We saw that there was a fair bit more work for us to do with drafting the idea. Tried to plan a meeting but it didn't happen.
Monday -  Planned meeting again, and this time it did happen. Draft proposal was fleshed out a lot more clearly. Better objectives were described. I redid my description to correspond to our new objectives. The team researched carefully on issues including drawbacks of preexisting sound editors, and minor things we forgot e.g. no administrator.
Tuesday - Approval was given for the project. Polished up description further. Team members were understandably tired so we agreed to continue this later.
