for loading, we need to:
start from index '/' (assume usertoken and poname exist and are valid)
fetch project using the usertoken and poname. If either does not exist or are invalid, do not call fetch
fetch should return the audio files in readstream format
convert this into blobs
upload blob using uploadHandler
